# Welcome to the Mattermost UDS Package

Thank you for your interest in this Defense Unicorns UDS Package!

This document describes the process and requirements for contributing to this UDS Package.

## Developer Experience

Continuous Delivery is core to our development philosophy. Check out [https://minimumcd.org](https://minimumcd.org) for a good baseline agreement on what that means.

Specifically:

* We do trunk-based development (main) with short-lived feature branches that originate from the trunk, get merged into the trunk, and are deleted after the merge
* We don't merge code into main that isn't releasable
* We perform automated testing on all changes before they get merged to main
* Continuous integration (CI) pipeline tests are definitive
* We create immutable release artifacts

### Developer Workflow

:key: == Required by automation

1. Drop a comment in any issue to let everyone know you're working on it and submit a Draft PR (step 4) as soon as you are able.
2. :key: Set up your Git config to GPG sign all commits. [Here's some documentation on how to set it up](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits). You won't be able to merge your PR if you have any unverified commits.
3. Create a Draft Pull Request as soon as you can, even if it is just 5 minutes after you started working on it. We lean towards working in the open as much as we can.
   > ⚠️ **NOTE:** _:key: We use [Conventional Commit messages](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) in PR titles so, if you can, use one of `fix:`, `feat:`, `chore:`, `docs:` or similar.  If you need help, just use `wip:` and we'll help with the rest_
4. :key: Automated tests will begin based on the paths you have edited in your Pull Request.
   > ⚠️ **NOTE:** _If you are an external third-party contributor, the pipelines won't run until a [CODEOWNER](./CODEOWNERS) approves the pipeline run._
5. :key: Be sure to heed the `needs-adr`,`needs-docs`,`needs-tests` labels as appropriate for the PR. Once you have addressed all of the needs, remove the label or request a maintainer to remove it.
6. Once the review is complete and approved, a core member of the project will merge your PR. If you are an external third-party contributor, two core members of the project will be required to approve the PR.
7. Close the issue if it is fully resolved by your PR. _Hint: You can add "Fixes #XX" to the PR description to automatically close an issue when the PR is merged._

### Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

We've chosen to use ADRs to document architecturally significant decisions. We primarily use the guidance found in [this article by Michael Nygard](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions) with a couple of tweaks:

- The criteria for when an ADR is needed is undefined. The team will decide when the team needs an ADR.
- We will use the tool [adr-tools](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools) to make it easier on us to create and maintain ADRs.
- We will keep ADRs specific to this package in the repository under `adr/NNNN-name-of-adr.md`.
  > `adr-tools` is configured with a dotfile to automatically use this directory and format.
- We will keep ADRs relating to Software Factory as a whole in the [UDS Software Factory](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/uds-software-factory) repository under `adr/NNNN-name-of-adr.md`.

### How to use `adr-tools`

```bash
# Create a new ADR titled "Use Bisquick for all waffle making"
adr new Use Bisquick for all waffle making

# Create a new ADR that supersedes a previous one. Let's say, for example, that the previous ADR about Bisquick was ADR number 9.
adr new -s 9 Use scratch ingredients for all waffle making

# Create a new ADR that amends a previous one. Let's say the previous one was ADR number 15
adr new -l "15:Amends:Amended by" Use store-bought butter for all waffle making

# Get full help docs. There are all sorts of other helpful commands that help manage the decision log.
adr help
```
